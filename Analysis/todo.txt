Final report
4-5 page report in 2 column IEEE Conf format
[0.5-1 page] Introduction and background – what is the problem area? Why is it important? What is the specific
problem you seek to solve?
[0.5 -1 page] Previous work – A brief review of only the most relevant predecessor work; what limitations have you
identified that you seek to address in your work? What are the assumptions you have made about the data/ problem
area or the scope of the problem you seek to solve?
[1.5 - 2 pages] Proposed solution – an overview of the various components of your solution (preprocessing +
building a model + evaluation)
This is to be followed by a detailed explanation of each component and what you have
[1.5-2 pages] Experimental results and a detailed explanation of all the insights you have gained into the data (on
what cases does the model work well? When does it fail?)
[0.5 page] Conclusions
[Not included in page count] Contribution of each team member + References + [optional] Anything interesting you
would like us to know (either some interesting technical find or about the problem domain or just the experience of
working on the project, etc.) Also, an Appendix with any further visualizations or tables of comparison not included
in the main paper.
Plagiarism check: Please submit your report to librarian@pes.edu and upload this also with your report
(you can refine your report to reduce the similarity if you complete this check well in time).

[1 min] What problem have you selected and what data set are you using to solve the problem?
[1 min] Why is what you have done important/ useful?
[1 min] What is the approach you have taken?
[1 min] How did you evaluate your solution/ the algorithm you implemented?
[1 min] Anything interesting that you inferred about the data or learnt through the process? Also, the specific role of
each member of the team.
